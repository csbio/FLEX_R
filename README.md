# FLEX_R
R package for FLEX (Functional evaluation of experimental perturbations), a pipeline that utilizes several functional annotation resources (Complex, Pathway, GO BP) to establish reference standards for systematic evaluation of genome-wide CRISPR screens. FLEX can investigate both single mutant (fitness) or double mutant (genetic interaction) experiments. FLEX summarizes the functional signal captured by these experiments, both globally (gene-pair level) and locally (protein complex level, for example). FLEX highlights the functional information captured by an experiment (and/or scoring method) and also compare and contrast functional information from multiple experiments (or competing scoring schemes).
