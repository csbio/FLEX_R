# FLEX_R
R package for FunctionaL Evaluation of eXperimental perturbations (FLEX). FLEX utilizes genome-wide functional annotation datasets (Complex, Pathway, GO etc.) to systematically evaluate experimental perturbation screens. It can investigate single mutant (fitness) or double mutant (genetic interaction) knock-out experiments. FLEX summarizes the functional signal captured by these experiments, both globally and locally (i.e. individual protein complexes). FLEX highlights the functional information captured by an experiment (and/or scoring method) and also compare and contrast functional information from multiple experiments (or competing scoring schemes).
