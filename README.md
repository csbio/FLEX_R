# FLEX_R
This package provides the R code for FunctionaL Evaluation of eXperimental perturbations (FLEX). FLEX utilizes genome-wide functional annotation standards (Complex, Pathway, GO etc.) to systematically evaluate experimental perturbation screens. FLEX can be employed to investigate single mutant (fitness) or double mutant (genetic interaction) knock-out experiments. It summarizes the functional signal captured by these experiments, globally, and also deconstructs the signal to implicate the local entities (individual protein complexes for example) contributing to the signal. In essence, FLEX recapitulates the global and local functional signal enabled by experimental screens that can be used to reveal the functional properties from an experiment (or scoring scheme) or compare and contrast functional signal between experiments (or competing scoring schemes).
