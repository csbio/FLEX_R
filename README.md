# FLEX_R
R code for FunctionaL Evaluation of eXperimental perturbations (FLEX). FLEX utilizes genome-wide functional annotation standards (Complex, Pathway, GO etc.) to systematically evaluate experimental perturbation screens. It can be employed to investigate single mutant (fitness) or double mutant (genetic interaction) knock-out experiments. FLEX summarizes the functional signal captured by these experiments, globally and locally (i.e. individual protein complexes). It can be used to reveal the functional properties of an experiment (and/or scoring method) and also compare and contrast functional signal from multiple experiments (or competing scoring schemes).
