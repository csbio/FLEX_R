# FLEX_R
R package for FLEX (Functional evaluation of experimental perturbations), pipeline that utilizes several functional annotation resources (Complex, Pathway, GO BP) to to establish reference standards for systematic evaluation of genome-wide perturbation screens. FLEX can investigate both single mutant (fitness) or double mutant (genetic interaction) knock-out experiments. FLEX summarizes the functional signal captured by these experiments, both globally and locally (i.e. individual protein complexes). FLEX highlights the functional information captured by an experiment (and/or scoring method) and also compare and contrast functional information from multiple experiments (or competing scoring schemes).
